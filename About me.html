    <h1 class="h2">About Maake Gift</h1>
    <p>I am a graduate from the university of limpopo holding a degree in Mathematical sciences <br>
        where I majored in computer sciences and Applied Mathematics. I am a dedicated and  <br>
        hard working individual as I put more effort in what I do.
    </p>
    <p>I am mostly interested in the field of Computer Sciences as is has proven to be the most <br>
    successful given the rise of technology and its implimentations in terms of coding, AI, etc. </p>

    <p>I moved to Soweto in Gauteng few months after graduating to seek better opportunities and <br>
    to grow my skills and better myself </p>
    
    <br>
    <h1 class="h2A">Educational Background</h1>
    <p class="h2B">I attended my high school in Tzaneen a town in Limpopo where I was born in and completed in 2015<br>
    and was offered an opportunity to study for an IT qualificatin at UJ and a Computer Sciences one at UL. <br>
    I Took the in Limpopo to remain close to home.The degree was a bit challenging as I had my issues with maths <br>
     and it lead to my degree being completed in 5 years.</p>

     <p class="h2B">The above mentioned is my formal education and I have some few other certificates that I earned through my<br>
    own efforts through online platforms</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h2">Projects I have Worked on</h1>
    <p>I was first introduced to programming on my first year and since then we only wrote small progrmas to see if we grasp the concepts<br>
    We did not don any big projects until our final year and we did the project in groups of 5</p>
    <p>The first project I worked on with my group was creating a platform that allows people to list their<br>
    organisation mostly NGOs on it and accepting donations through it like a gofundme scheme. The plaform worked<br>
    but it had issues especially in temrms of security and others so we ended up with a final mark of 63% </p>

    <p>The second one was to simulate a deadlock between vehicles so we were not restricted to programming<br>
    so we took advantage of this and used blender and the project was a success as we ended up scoring above 90%</p>

    <p>The most recent Project I worked on was last year which started in November. We were tasked with implimenting<br>
    the strategy of the company using the a corporater system (Which was our first project after completing our trainig).<br>
     Although we did start with the project we were unable to finishsince almost every one in the company was retrenched <br>
      to due the company having financial issue </p>

      <h1 class="h2A">Educational Background</h1>
      <p class="h2B">I worked for a company named Waraco in Sandton as an intern for 4 months where we recieved trainig for<br>
      developing GRC (Governance, Risk and compliance) systems of companies by means of configuring instead of coding.<br>
      This was a nice concept but unforunately we were retrenched early this year in January due to the company having financial issues</p>
